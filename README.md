#Angular Masonry Demo
#### masonry :6 version
#### angular :6 version
#### angular/material: 6 version

In my machine i have global version of angular as 10,but as far as know masonry supports angular 6 version.
###### _To this demo, i have done following steps_
* Firstly,created a folder named Demo, in that ,i have installed angular version 6 using this command

>npm install  @angular/cli@6.0.3

* Now, I have **ANGULAR CLI 6 VERSION **
* In, that same folder i have created a project **masonrydemo** using
> ng new Masonrydemo

* it created wit a project of cli local version 6
* Now, i have to install **_ANGULAR MASONRY_**
* To install Peer dependencies
> npm install masonry-layout imagesloaded --save

* To install ng-masonry-grid library, run:

> npm install ng-masonry-grid --save


As, i'm using cli version of 6,i'm installing angular material of same version to avoid conflicts.

>  npm install --save @angular/material@6  @angular/cdk@6
 * angular-cdk is for dependencies of angular material.
 
 Done,Now you can successfully create an **Angular Masonry Application**
